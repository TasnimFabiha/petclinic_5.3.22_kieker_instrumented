Kieker 2.0.2 didn't capture useful traces in Petclinic 5.3.22 â†’ Switched to Kieker 1.15.
Kieker 1.15 worked for monitoring but failed with Java 17 when converting traces.
Java 11 was required for trace analysis (.dat â†’ .dot â†’ .pdf conversion).
Switched between Java 17 and Java 11 depending on the task.

# Instrumented Spring Petclinic 5.3.22 with Kieker 1.15

This repository contains the **Spring Petclinic 5.3.22** application instrumented with **Kieker 1.15** for performance monitoring and trace analysis.

## ðŸ“¥ Downloading the Original Project
The original **Spring Petclinic 5.3.22** project was downloaded from:
- **GitHub Repository**: [Spring Framework Petclinic](https://github.com/spring-petclinic/spring-framework-petclinic)
- **Release Version**: 5.3.22

The original `pom.xml` was modified to integrate **Kieker 1.15** for performance monitoring.
Since the project primarily utilized `jetty-web.xml` for servlet configuration and did not include a `web.xml`, a **custom `web.xml` file** was introduced in `WEB-INF/` to facilitate Kieker instrumentation.

---
### **Initial Build and Compatibility Adjustments**
Before integrating Kieker, the project was built and tested in its original form to ensure compatibility.

#### **Issue: Jacoco Version Compatibility**
- The existing **Jacoco Maven Plugin** version was outdated and incompatible with the projectâ€™s build.
- **Resolution:** The Jacoco Maven Plugin was updated in `pom.xml` as follows:

  <jacoco-maven-plugin>0.8.12</jacoco-maven-plugin>
- After this the project builds and compiles successfully with both java 11, java 17

## ðŸ›  Instrumentation Process

# Instrumentation of Spring Petclinic 5.3.22 with Kieker 1.15

> **Reference Guide Followed:**  
> The instrumentation was implemented based on the official Kieker documentation:  
> ðŸ”— **[How to Perform Trace Analysis - Kieker Monitoring](https://kieker-monitoring.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/How-to-perform-Trace-Analysis.html#prerequisites)**.


To enable **trace analysis** using Kieker, the following modifications were made:

### ** Added web.xml with the integrated interceptor

### ** Added Kieker 1.15 Dependency in pom**
The `pom.xml` file was modified to include:
<dependency>
    <groupId>net.kieker-monitoring</groupId>
    <artifactId>kieker</artifactId>
    <version>1.15</version>
</dependency>

### ** Spring Petclinic already included AspectJ version 1.9.7; therefore, no additional dependency was required **

### ** the AspectJ Maven Plugin (version 1.15) was integrated to enable instrumentation in the build section**

# Note for future reference

## Older spring framework version (petclinic 5.3.22 that uses javax servlet) needed to use to instrument with Kieker since Kieker doesn't support jakarta servlet [Kieker Issue](https://github.com/kieker-monitoring/kieker/issues/2840)

## After collecting the traces (.dat and .map), for using trace analysis command (converting the .dat file to .dot) java version needed to downgrade to java 11 to java 17.
